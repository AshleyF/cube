# Trainer

Produce random cases across a set of algs. Solve them with a Giiker cube.

The Giiker may be held in any orientation (I even took the stickers off mine!). The solution may be any alg that works (even mistakes/corrections).

## TODO

* Disconnect button is broken
* Check whole cube state
* CFOP vs. Roux, COLL/CMLL differences (scramble M slice, random U center [makes full color neutrality difficult])
* Countdown on timeouts
* Move-based advancing
* Roofpig-less (optimization)
