# Giiker Bluetooth Prototype

This is a prototype page to time splits in Roux solves using the [Giiker Supercube](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Xiaomi-Giiker-Super-Rubik-s-Cube-Learn-With-Fun-Bluetooth-Connection-Sensing-Identification-Intellectual-Development-Toy/32881376857.html). [Give it a try!](https://ashleyf.github.io/cubing/site/bluetooth/)

The idea is to recognize various stages of a solve by pattern matching. For example, first block, second block, CO/CP, edge orientation, UL/UR, last four edges. Some phases are even further broken down into first pair, second pair, etc. and corners oriented, corners permuted, ... All is recorded and times roll up.

For this prototype, we assume a particular down/left color pair. I personally use white/blue. This can be changed in code (`downAnchor`/`leftAnchor`) and all of the patterns will be remapped. The Giiker cube has no IMU, so no sense of the orientation it's being held. We assume the anchor edge remains anchored throughout the solve. Because of this anchor, we can then translate slice moves. That is, `L' R` is interpreted as `M` for example. We can also remap wide twists with an assumption that `D` and `L` twists are actually `u` and `r`. One small exception is that `L`/`L'` are allowed while inserting first block pairs. This is all very specific to Roux and to my personal style. But, it's just a prototype. The idea would be to make this much more general and configurable...

This uses larspetrus' [Roofpig](https://github.com/larspetrus/Roofpig) to render the cube and a modified version of lgarron's [giiker.js](https://github.com/cubing/bluetooth) used also in his [much more polished site](https://bluetooth.cubing.net/). It depends on [web bluetooth support](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/gh-pages/implementation-status.md#chrome).
