# Intro

- For Kayden
- Book & cube
- Solve *any* scramble (soon much faster than me)

Hey there Kayden! I hope you like the book and the new cube.t, (For anyone else watching this: I just gave these to my grandson, Kayden, and made this video to teach him to solve, but you could learn too.) It's a pretty nifty book and it's a true story about this kid, Andres, who gets into cubing with his friend, Kino. Works really hard and solves it! Then he gets really sucked into it; learning algorithms and trying to get really fast and goes to competitions. This 15.26 second solve is pretty amazing, and it's real. Here's his World Cube Association page. There he is and here's the 15.26. It was his first solve at U.S. Nationals in 2017. Pretty cool!

So here's your cube. It's a nice, brand new, GAN Infinity, half-bright colors. I like how bright the yellow and orange are and how dark the red blue are. It's very smooooth and fun to turn. It has magnets so it kind of snaps into place. Hopefully it'll last you your first 10,000 solves. But first we need to get to your *first* solve. I'll teach you how to do it.

## Anatomy

- Like when Andres' popped, let's take it appart
- Centers (6, opposites, blue/green together (book!), remaining together)
- Edges (12 places, flipped 2 ways)
- Corners (8 places, twisted 3 ways) 

When I was a kid I always took apart all my toys. We won't take your cube apart (I'll put it back in the bag), but let's take apart one of mine; just like when Andres' popped apart.

This is how the puzzle actually works. It's this "core" with center pieces attached and all these loose pieces are just held in and rotate around. Notice that the centers can't move anywhere they like. Yellow and white are always opposite, orange and red are opposite and green and blue are opposite. So, funny enough actually, this cube in the book is impossibe! The green side can't be next to the blue side! Silly. 

Then there are 12 edge pieces that have two colors. Sometimes people see a cube and think you can just move the colors whereever you like. But no, you're moving these *pieces* around. The blue ones for example: we have BR, BO, BY and BW. So we're solving these *pieces*. In fact this BW will be the very first one we solve in a minute. There is no BG. That's impossible like in the book.

There are 8 corners. Each have three colors. Again the blue ones, we have BRY, BRW, BOY, BOW (this BOW happens to be the first corner we solve).

Let's put this cube back together and learn how to solve as we go.

## Method

- Strategy with few algorithms
    - Kino said, "All you have to do is learn the algorithms."
    - Kino also said, "The more you memorize, the easier it is..."
- Roux (world class, easy to start, 2 algorithms)
    - First block
    - Second block
    - Top corners
    - Last six edges

The method we'll use is called Roux (R O U X if you try to search for it; named after the guy who invented it - a French guy named Gilles Roux). It's a very easy method to learn; only a couple of algorithms to get started. Like Kino says in the book, "The more you memorize, the easier it is..." We can start without having to memorize very much, but there's plenty of room to learn more and get faster later.

This is a world-class method. Some of the fastest cubers in the world use this method. Sean Patrick Villanueva is my favorite. He got 2nd place at Worlds in 2019 (missing 1st place average by just 0.04 seconds). He has the national record for the Philippines (where he's from) with less than 5 seconds (4.98) using Roux!

These are the steps we'll do. First, we'll get these six pieces in place on the left (notice that it's not just the blue color, but the correct pieces with white down, red front and orange back; just like on a solved cube). Then we'll get another six on the right side (the same thing, but green). Then we'll solve the corners on the top. And finally, we can easily get the centers and we'll solve the last six edges. And then it's done! Let's get started!

# 1 First Block

- Blue 2x2x3 block (W down)
- DL edge (rotation) #1 (of 12 places, "inspection")
- L center (of 5 places, #2 + G)
    - Aligned? Wide U
    - Top? Down, then wide U
    - Bottom? Up, then wide U
- BOW pair
    - Tuck BO (of 11 places, without messing up DL/C, flipped either way)
    - BOW to top without W up (of 8 places)
    - Pair up and insert (#4 two inserts, keep together, move freedom)
        - M slice demo
- BRW pair
    - Tuck BR (of 10 places, any flip, move freedom)
    - BRW to top without W up (of 7 places)
    - Pair up and insert (#6 two inserst, together, freedom)

# 2 Second Block

- Green 2x2x3 block (W down)
- G center done (#7)!
- Freedom (U, R/r, F/B, M!)
- DR edge
    - Top with W up (of 9 places)
    - Pair and rotate down (#8)
- GOW pair
    - Tuck GO (of 8 places, any flip)
    - GOW to top without W up (of 6 places)
        - Temporary disturb
    - Pair up and insert (#10, together)
         - Tricky insert
- GRW pair
    - Tuck GR (of 7 places)
    - GRW to top without W up (of 5 places)
    - Pair up and insert (#12)

# 3 Top Corners (CMLL)

- Orient corners (all Y in top, 4 belong on top)
    - Single Y on top, move to upper-lower-left
    - Not single (2 or none), move any to front-lower-left
    - Algorithm: R U R' U R U2 R' (R back and forth) ("Sune")
    - Lucky, single, (sometimes twice)
    - 5 other examples (2 on top -> 3 tries, none on top -> 4 tries)
- Permute corners
    - Pair (if any) on left ("headlights")
    - Algorithm: R U R' F' R U R' U' R' F R2 U' R' ("JPerm" - YouTube!)
        - If no pair (there is now! in F), do JPerm once more
        - Pairs all around (rotate into place if you like, #16)

# Last Six Edges (LSE)

- Can orient centers if you like (last six remaining, W on top is fine)
- 4a Oriented edge (EO) examples (W or Y on top & bottom, M & U only free)
    - "Arrow" case: M' U' M'
    - Otherwise, upper/right and M' U' M'
    - Two repeating cases (2 up + 2 up/2 down)
- 4b Left/Right (LR)
    - Both on bottom? Align, slip in and place
    - One bottom, one top?
        - Diagonally opposite
        - Face up/down, stack, move to bottom
    - Both top?
        - Opposite? Put on bottom
        - Adjacent? Put one on bottom (M2)
- 4c Last Four Edges (M/U2 free, not worried about EO anymore)
    - M' U2
